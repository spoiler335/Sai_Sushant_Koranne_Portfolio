Welcome to my game development portfolio! Here you can find a collection of the games I've developed, along with information about my skills and experience in game development.

## About Me

I’m a Game Programmer in training at DePaul University, with 3 years of industry experience split between game development and software engineering. I specialize in C#, Unity, C++, and Unreal Engine, and I’ve worked across both 2D and 3D projects—from building gameplay systems to refining player interactions. What excites me most is crafting worlds and mechanics that pull players in and keep them engaged, blending technical precision with creative design.

For futher information you can refer my [Resume](./Sai%20Sushant%20Koranne-Resume.pdf).


## My Work

### Game Engine By Dx11 Abstraction using C++ (Inprogress)

1. DirectX 11 Abstraction for 3D Rendering: Architected and implemented a custom rendering pipeline in C++ by abstracting DirectX 11, enabling efficient rendering of 3D models, textures, and UV maps. This highlights expertise in graphics API programming and rendering techniques.
2. Custom Resource Management System for 3D Assets: Developed a custom file library to manage the loading and handling of various 3D assets, including models, textures, and UV maps, ensuring efficient resource management and streamlined asset pipeline.
3. Real-time Object Transformation and Manipulation: Implemented core 3D transformations (translation, rotation, and scaling) on loaded 3D models, demonstrating a fundamental understanding of 3D rendering pipelines and scene graph management.
4. Custom Math Library for 3D Graphics Operations: Created a custom math library, encompassing vector and matrix operations, specifically tailored to handle 3D graphics transformations efficiently. This shows a strong grasp of linear algebra and its practical application in game development.
5. PCS Tree for 3D Scene Management: Designed and implemented a custom PCS tree structure, showcasing the ability to organize and manage 3D objects within the game world for improved scalability and performance.
6. Foundational Game Engine Development: Successfully developed a core set of features for a custom game engine, including rendering, asset loading, and scene management, demonstrating a holistic approach to building a foundational game development platform.

### Racing Game Using Reinforcement Learning(Unity)

Description: 

1. A flight racing game, where the enemy agents are trained using Reinforcement Learning. 
2. A positive Reward is given whenever the agent passes through the check point.
3. If the agent misses the check point a negative reward is awarded.

### Space Invaders Game(C#- Custom Game Engine)

Descrption:

1. Design Pattern-Driven Architecture: Designed the core architecture of the Space Invaders game using C#, employing various design patterns including Factory for dynamic object creation (bullets, enemies), Observer for event handling (score updates, game state changes), and State for managing different enemy behaviors or game modes.
2. Modular & Extensible Gameplay: Utilized design patterns to ensure modularity and extensibility of game systems, allowing for easy integration of new enemy types, power-ups, or gameplay mechanics without extensive code refactoring.
3. Real-time Performance & Behavior: Implemented design patterns like Strategy for different enemy movement or attack patterns, ensuring flexible and optimized real-time behavior within the custom C# engine. According to Medium, these patterns help build scalable, maintainable, and flexible games.
4. Efficient Object Management: Applied patterns such as Object Pool (implicitly or explicitly) to manage bullet and enemy instances, optimizing performance by reducing object instantiation and destruction overhead.

### Audio Engine Usimg C++ in Multithread Aritechture

1. Developed a C++ multithreaded runtime audio engine library, utilizing the XAudio2 API for low-level audio processing and playback.
2. Designed and implemented multithreaded components, including custom handles, inter-threading queuing system, and thread tracking for efficient audio management.
3. Integrated advanced features like asynchronous real-time loading/streaming and a dynamic preemptive priority system for seamless audio experiences.
4. Enabled flexible audio control through application-defined user callbacks and data-driven script playback.
5. Validated engine robustness through a series of mini-demos, proving the feasibility of the multithreaded audio solution.
